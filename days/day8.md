### What is the difference between authentication and authorization?
````
Authentication is the process of verifying that a user really is who they claim to be, whereas authorization involves verifying whether a user is allowed to do something.

In the context of a website or web application, authentication determines whether someone attempting to access the site with the username Anishka really is the same person who created the account.

Once Anishka is authenticated, her permissions determine whether or not he is authorized, for example, to access personal information about other users or perform actions such as deleting another user's account.
