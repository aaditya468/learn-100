### What is Recon in Bug Bounty Hunting ?

````
Recon means gathering information about a target. It could  be information related to the subdomains, services used by them etc. 
Sometimes recon can go beyond collecting basic information to understand the system and can also identify information which might 
straight away lead to exploitation, sometimes without actually touching the entity being tested.

Even after having such significance this phase is not given enough importance and most of the tests focus straight away on 
exploitation. The key point here is that exploitation is certainly important but performing a thorough recon could prove very 
helpful in it and also make it easier, faster and stealthier.

### Why ?
````
Find a bigger attack surface 
More bugs
More bounties
````

### Determing the target 
````
Everyone wants to choose a program that has wide scope so that you can can get wider range of vulerabilities within the scope.
Understand which all domains are in scope. 
````

### Mapping the target 

````
Read all terms of the program and understand which domains are in scope and which forms of vulnerabilities are considered valid reports.
Recon and gather as much information as you can to effectively map the application
Make notes of everything properly
