### What is fuzzing ?
````
In the world of cybersecurity, fuzzing is the usually automated process of finding hackable software bugs by randomly 
feeding different permutations of data into a target program until one of those permutations reveals a vulnerability. 

The purpose of fuzzing relies on the assumption that there are bugs within every program, which are waiting to be discovered. Therefore, a systematic approach should find them sooner or later.

Fuzzing can add another point of view to classical software testing techniques (hand code review, debugging) because of it’s 
non-human approach. It doesn’t replace them, but is a reasonable complement, thanks to the limited work needed to put the 
procedure in place.

### Why is it important ?
````
It will help you in increasing the scope by finding some files or directories that are hidden.  
You can find some hidden endpoints
You can find default configured servers, some api keys, tokens etc.
